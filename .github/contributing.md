# Contributing to the Cambiatus Backend

First off, thank you so much for taking the time to contribute to this project. With help from people like
you around the world we make Cambiatus what it is.

Following these guidelines while contributing helps us ensure that we can find better and more efficient ways of working together. This in turn helps the whole community collaborate better and achieve higher heights in its endavours.

Our team at Cambiatus loves receiving contributions from the community. It is indeed contributors like you that have enabled us and continue to enable us to build the tools we build. There are many ways of contributing to the Cambiatus Backend you could help with commnunity management, writing manuals, teaching, submitting bug reports and feature request or even writing code that get used by the entire Cambiatus community.

Please don't use Github Issues to get support questions. Check whether the #devs channel on the [Cambiatus Open Source Discord Servers](https://discord.gg/3X58Qvx) can help you get your question answered.

## Your first contribution
First of all take a deep breath and relax, everyone started exactly where you are.

- Unsure where to begin contributing to the Cambiatus backend? You can start by looking through issues tagged with `good-first-issue` these are issues that involve easy tasks that whet your appetite for more and show you around.
- `Help wanted issues` - these are issues that may be a little more involved for a beginner but ultimately also a good foray into the codebase.

Working on your first Open Source contribution? You can learn how from this free series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first ðŸ˜¸

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

## Before you get started
0. The very first step to take before submitting a PR is know what constitutes a good PR. So we encourage you to read these articles before making your PR request:
    1. [The anatomy of a perfect pull request](https://medium.com/@hugooodias/the-anatomy-of-a-perfect-pull-request-567382bb6067#:~:text=A%20good%20pull%20request%20will,and%20consequently%20the%20product%20development.)
    2. [How should I write a good pull request?](https://blog.carbonfive.com/why-write-good-pull-requests/)
    3. [Pull Request Etiquette](https://gist.github.com/mikepea/863f63d6e37281e329f8)
1. Fork the repo, this enables you to open PRs and push them.
2. Work the [setup guide](/.github/setup.md)
3. Run the test suite `mix test`. Please note we only accept pull requests with passing tests, and it's awesome to make one pass. Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without forking the repo. 

If you find a security vulnerability, we **urge** you to open an issue!

Bug reports can be filed using the issue template on this projects github repository, This format enables us to respond quicker and clearly to any bug reports.

## When filing an issue, make sure to answer these four questions:
 1. What version of the backend are you using (mix: version)?
 2. What did you do?
 3. What did you expect to see?
 4. What did you see instead?

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement
Many of the features that this backend has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work. We tend to prefer that our feature request and enhancements start as issues, formatted this way they make it very clear to the whole community what the aim of the request is and how it will change the work.

# Code review process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly triage meeting that we hold. The meeting is announced in the weekly status updates that are send on Monday mornings.
After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

## PR review in detail
1. The purpose of PR description is to provide all the necessary information so the reviewer can **thoroughly** and **effectively** review the code. Ensure your PR answers the following questions: 
    1. Summary of the issue being solved. Ideally a link to the issue that's being solved.
    2. How is the issue being solved.
    3. How can we verify the solution.
2. Prior to creating a PR ensure there are no merge conflicts (for draft and [WIP] PR this is temporarily omitted).
3. Once a pull request is sent, we will assign a member to review your PR.
4. A reviewer will check and verify the changes purposed by the PR. He/she will look for the following items:
    1. CI/CD workflow passes all test.
    2. Verify the solution based on PR description.
5. Once the PR has been validated and approvded by the reviewer, the next step is to get approval from our QA team. We will test the PR on our [staging server](staging.cambiatus.io). If the integration test passes then the PR is ready to be merged into `master` and tested on `production`.

# Releases
1. If the integration test passes then will push the change to `production` or `demo` sever and conduct a final test.
2. If all test passes, then we are live!

# Community
You can chat with the core team on the discord channel linked above. We try to be available on all weekdays.

# Deployment
Deployment is very straight forward in Cambiatus. We use standard Elixir releases so you'll need just some quick steps:

1. On the server, `cd` to `~/apps/backend`
2. Release the app: `MIX_ENV=prod mix release cambiatus`
3. Reset PM2: `pm2 delete backend && pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production --update-env && pm2 logs backend`


## Cambiatus App operations on the server

As any [releasable](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/config-and-releases.html) Elixir app, you'll get a few commands, trsf Elixir's docs if you need more information.

Useful migrations commands:
  * `~/apps/backend/_build/prod/rel/cambiatus/bin/cambiatus eval "Cambiatus.Release.migrate()"` to migrate
  * `~/apps/backend/_build/prod/rel/cambiatus/bin/cambiatus eval "Cambiatus.Release.rollback(Cambiatus.Repo, 1)"` to rollback 1 step
  * `~/apps/backend/_build/prod/rel/cambiatus/bin/cambiatus eval "Cambiatus.Release.seed()"` to seed
